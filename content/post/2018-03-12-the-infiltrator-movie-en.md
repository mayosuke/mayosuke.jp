I watched the movie ["The Infiltrator" (2016 film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infiltrator_(2016_film)) last weekend. 

Robert Mazur (played by Bryan Cranston), An American DEA(Drug Enforcement Administration) undercover agent investigates the organization of [a Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar)'s cartel.

During the investigation, he earns the trust of the executives, and finds important evidence deep within the cartel.
Meanwhile, as a result of earning their trust, Robert has a conflict of interests in dealing with him as a mere investigation target or a friend.

I think an undercover agent is playing a role playing game in real life.
It might be exciting, but I don't want to play such a game because it's too risky.
