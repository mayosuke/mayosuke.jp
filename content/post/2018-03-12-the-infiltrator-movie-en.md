I watched the movie ["The Infiltrator" (2016 film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infiltrator_(2016_film)) last weekend. 

Robert Mazur (played by Bryan Cranston), An American DEA(Drug Enforcement Administration) undercover agent investigates the organization of [a Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar)'s cartel.

He gets trust with the executives of the cartel in the process of the intrusive investigation,
go into the back of the cartel deeply and gets important evidence.
Meanwhile, as a result of having a friendship with an executive, Robert experiences conflicted feeling in dealing with him as a mere investigation target or a friend.

I think an undercover agent is playing a role playing game in real life.
It might be exciting, but I don't want to play such a game because it's too risky.
